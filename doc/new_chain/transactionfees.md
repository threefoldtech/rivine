# Transaction fees

Setting a transaction fee is important since having all free transactions allows an attacker to flood the network and blocks with meaningless transactions at no cost.
This dos attack prevents regular transactions to get included in the chain.
While there are schemes to allow a certain number of free transaction, Rivine currently has no support for this. 

The transaction fees are collected by the blockcreators so they also provide a way to support the network.
